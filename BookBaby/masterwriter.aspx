		<h2 class="title-bold">MasterWriter is the perfect Writing Partner</h2>
		<p>There’s a reason why successful writers William Peter Blatty, Bob Zemeckis, Andrew Davis, Paul Brickman, Peter Seaman and many more all use MasterWriter: it is simply the most powerful suite of writing tools ever assembled in one program.  Why struggle to find the right word when you can have all the possibilities in an instant?</p>
 

		<h2 class="title-bold">MasterWriter 3.0 gives you all the options</h2>
		<p>MasterWriter gives you Synonyms, Word Families, Phrases, Alliterations, Pop-Culture, Rhymes, the Definition and much more.  The greatest enemy of creativity is distraction. Searching a bookshelf of reference dictionaries, or bouncing from one website to the next trying to find the right word is a distraction. One search in MasterWriter will show you all of the possibilities instantly, including a vast array of descriptive words that you will not find in any other reference dictionary or thesaurus.  The new version 3.0 is web–based, so you can leave the house empty–handed and access MasterWriter on any computer, tablet or smart phone, wherever you are.  </p>
 

		<h2 class="title-bold">BookBaby Exclusive</h2>
