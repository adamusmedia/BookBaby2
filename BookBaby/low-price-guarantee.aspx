	            <p>Never fear about overpaying for your printed books again. BookBaby now guarantees its prices are the lowest around.</p>
	            <p><strong>Here's what our Low Price Promise means:</strong> We will match any written quote on an identical book from any reputable U.S. printer. It's that simple.</p>
	            <p>Our prices are super low already. But we’re rolling out the Low Price Promise to protect you. Every once in a while we hear from a customer who has bought from another company to save a few bucks, and ended up unhappy with their purchase. We don't want that to happen to you! So now, thanks to our LPP, there’s absolutely no reason to ever have to compromise between price and quality. With BookBaby, you get both.</p>
