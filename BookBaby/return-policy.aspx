	<h2 class="title-bold">Our return and cancellation policy in plain english</h2>
	<p>BookBaby guarantees the customer's satisfaction with cover and text proofs. If BookBaby cannot satisfy the customer, BookBaby will refund the entire deposit amount if customer wants to cancel the project. However, once proofs are approved BookBaby will charge for all work and services performed, even if the project is subsequently canceled.</p>

	<p>BookBaby warrants that material produced and delivered by BookBaby meets BookBaby' standard specifications for the material or such other specifications as described on our website and meets generally accepted industry standards.</p>

	<p>All custom-printed BookBaby products are unconditionally guaranteed against defects in quality and workmanship. If any custom-manufactured product produced by BookBaby from or through the use of materials is found to be defective in quality, or is shipped or labeled in error, BookBaby will replace or repair defective product and/or correct error in shipment or labeling at its own expense or, at BookBaby' option, refund to customer part or all of the purchase paid to BookBaby, on the condition that a) written notice of such defect or error is received by BookBaby at its office within thirty (30) days after shipment by BookBaby to customer, and b) the defect or error did not result from a defect or error in the materials supplied by or on behalf of the customer. If said notice is not received by BookBaby within the date indicated above, BookBaby will be deemed to be released by customer from any and all liability.</p>

	<p>The customer shall return any defective product to BookBaby should BookBaby so request. No merchandise may be returned to BookBaby without written return authorization by BookBaby. Product reruns or purchase price refunds will be prorated based on the quantity of defective merchandise returned.</p>

	<p>Prior to returning any product, you must obtain an RMA (return merchandise authorization) number from BookBaby. The RMA number must appear on your address label. BookBaby reserves the right to refuse delivery of any item returned without an RMA number.</p>

	<p>BookBaby is not responsible for any loss of revenue or profit or other financial damages of any kind whatsoever, whether direct or indirect, suffered by the customer for any reason whatsoever.</p>

	    
	<h2 class="title-bold">Order Cancellation</h2>

	<p>Orders for products not yet manufactured by BookBaby may be cancelled by either party at any time. The customer will be responsible for all costs incurred by BookBaby related to pre-manufacturing or manufacturing of any product, prior to receipt of notice of cancellation. After such cancellation, the customer's materials and any completed product may be delivered to the customer only after all sums owed to BookBaby have been paid in full by cash or check.</p>
