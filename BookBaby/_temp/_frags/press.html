     	<h2>BookBaby expands Print On Demand service to pay out highest royalties to self-published authors</h2>
		<h3>With POD on BookShop™, indie authors earn more, get paid faster, and enjoy guaranteed in-stock inventory status.</h3>

		<p><em>Pennsauken, NJ </em> – <a href="/">BookBaby</a> today announced its <a href="/print-on-demand">Print On Demand (POD) service</a> is now available through its <a href="/bookshop">BookShop™ direct-to-reader sales website</a>. Authors will earn an industry-leading 50% of the selling price for printed books sold through BookShop while enjoying all the convenience and low inventory costs that make POD an attractive option for authors.</p>

		<p>“Authors haven’t made much money with previous POD programs, and frankly, that’s just wrong,” says BookBaby President Steven Spatz. “When authors sell their printed books through BookBaby’s BookShop, they’ll make more than anywhere else—guaranteed.”</p>

		<p>For example, a typical Digest-sized black and white soft cover that retails for $9.99. Amazon will pay authors between $1.34 to $3.34 royalties. If that same book is sold through BookShop, authors will earn $5.00. BookBaby’s POD service can also include <a href="/hardcover-book-printing">hardcover books</a>, a book selection not found in other POD programs, including CreateSpace.</p>

		<p>BookBaby’s new service addresses two other issues with Print On Demand programs.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>	Faster payment: BookBaby deposits authors’ money into their accounts within one week after book orders are shipped. That compares to the standard 90 to 120 days lag in payments from Amazon and others.</li>
			<li>Guaranteed accessibility: Authors’ books are always in stock and ready to ship to readers—a feature exclusive to BookBaby.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>“During last Christmas, every POD program suffered through long periods where books were listed as out of stock,” says Spatz. “Tens of thousands of authors were frustrated by Amazon and Barnes & Noble supply chain breakdowns. But that can’t happen with BookShop. We don’t have to worry about inventory—we print and ship directly out of our factory to the reader. In fact, we guarantee our books are available 24/7 throughout the busiest holiday season. Nobody else in the industry can offer this.”</p>

		<p>BookBaby authors will be seeing more new features and services on the BookShop platform in the coming months. “With this new addition, our self-publishing authors have a true one-stop shop for readers to find more information about our authors and their books,” says Spatz. “It’s a critical resource for achieving success in self-publishing, and BookBaby is the only company that offers it.”</p>

		<p>BookShop is a free online storefront exclusive to BookBaby authors, giving them an easy way to earn more money selling their printed books and eBooks directly to readers. Minimal set-up is required to get started and authors have full control over their page content.</p>

     	<h2>BookBaby Launches Premium Editing Services for Self-Publishing Authors</h2>
		<h3>The nation’s leading self publisher introduces world class editing at working class prices. </h3>

		<p><em>Pennsauken, NJ </em> – <a href="/">BookBaby</a> today introduced its new breakthrough <a href="/book-editing-services">editing service for independent authors</a>. The new editing solution allows self-published authors access to a network of editors of some of today’s bestselling books at affordable prices–up to 50% less than other similar premium options.</p> 

<p><a href="/book-editing-services">BookBaby Editing Services</a> is another big step forward for authors who need a wide range of tools and services to print, promote, and <a href="/book-distribution">sell books</a> on their own. </p>

<p>“Every book needs editing–that’s an established fact,” says BookBaby President Steven Spatz. “Now every author can get the kind of top-notch editing they need. Our goal was to provide a cost-effective solution for self-publishing authors while maintaining the quality that they expect and deserve.”</p>

<p>BookBaby’s new program offers two book editing service options, Copy or Line Editing. The typical 60,000-word book will cost under $1,200 for Copy Editing–that’s 30 to 50% lower than other competing premium offers.</p>

<p>BookBaby’s team of editors is a collective of experienced professionals that hail from all over the world. Each book editor is proficient in line-by-line grammar and consistency edits as well as more complex elements such as tone, transition, and story structure. “Our authors will be working with the very same book editors that the top traditional publishers use,” says Spatz. “They’ve edited NY Times and Amazon best sellers across all genres–from sci-fi to young adult and beyond. Bottom line: Your words are in very good hands.”</p>

<p>A key factor in self-publishing’s consistent growth is its ability to get books to market faster than traditional releases–and BookBaby Editing Services looks to keep up with the pace. Authors can receive their professionally edited manuscript in as fast as 8 to 10 days, making it one of the most efficient services available.</p>

<p>“Here’s why our program is different–it’s not just about speed and price. It’s about providing a book editing service that keeps authors’ best interests as the priority,” says Spatz. “Our editing process is personalized by matching authors with book editors that specialize in their respective genres to yield the best possible results. And while the editor’s goal is always to improve the book, we understand this is a subjective process and authors may not always agree with the changes. But authors will always have the final say on their work, retaining control throughout the entire process.”

     	<h2>BookBaby offers a free dialogue writing course for authors  </h2>
		<h3>The nation’s leading self-publishing company has teamed up with AutoCrit to help authors strengthen their dialogue writing skills.</h3>

		<p><em>Pennsauken, NJ </em> – <a href="/">BookBaby</a>, along with AutoCrit—an online instant manuscript editor—has announced an exclusive giveaway of a three-part video series dedicated to helping authors write better dialogue for their books. </p>

The entire course is valued at $199, but BookBaby is giving you the opportunity to <a href="/free-guide/autocrit">get the AutoCrit dialogue series for free</a> for a limited time.</p>

		<p>“When an agent or editor receives an author’s manuscript, he or she will first read the dialogue to determine the book’s quality,” said Jocelyn Pruemer, Owner of AutoCrit. “Dialogue is used as a tool to move the plot forward, describe a setting, or even express a mood. When used effectively, strong dialogue helps your book engage readers on a deeper level and provides an overall greater experience.” </p>

		<p>The complete course touches on dialogue writing essentials including:
		<ul> 
			<li>Proper dialogue tag use</li>
			<li>Showing versus telling</li>
			<li>Manipulating tone and energy</li>
			<li>Grammar, punctuation, and formatting</li>
			<li>Avoiding cliché and stilted dialogue</li>
			<li>Sounding plausible and realistic</li>
			<li>And much more!</li>
		</ul>
</p>

     	<h2>BookBaby helps authors scale their Mt. NaNoWriMo writing challenge </h2>
		<h3>Beware of the LiterarYeti! Leading self-publishing company creates unique motivational calendar to help writers climb towards their 50,000-word goal</h3>

		<p><em>Pennsauken, NJ </em> – <a href="/">BookBaby</a>, the nation's leading self-publishing company, is climbing new heights to help motivate writers embarking on the National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) challenge. The company has created exclusive articles, writing tips, and a whimsical word-count calendar to help writers track their progress to the top of their novel writing summit.</p>
        
		<p>BookBaby's writing challenge theme for 2015 is "Mt. NaNoWriMo," a 50,000 word summit that's guarded by the mythical beast, the LiterarYeti. This fearsome-looking-but-friendly creature even has his own Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/literaryeti">@LiterarYeti</a>) and <a href="https://instagram.com/literaryeti">LiterarYeti Instagram</a> accounts. The motivational calendar helps authors to plan out their writing efforts, breaking the daunting 50,000 word task into smaller, more achievable goals.</p>
         
		<p>NaNoWriMo participants can download a PDF of the <a href="http://blog.bookbaby.com/nanowrimo/">BookBaby Mt. NaNoWriMo word count calendar</a> on our blog. 

		<p>"Writing a 50,000 word novel really is like climbing a mountain," said Steven Spatz, BookBaby President. "It's hard yet rewarding work. But that doesn't mean you can't also have a little fun along the way. NaNoWriMo is making a huge impact in the development of young writers around the globe, and our team has gone all-out to create something special for all the participants this year."</p>
         
		<p>"BookBaby has been a long-term supporter of NaNoWriMo and helped many writers on the next stage of their creative journey, publishing a book," said Grant Faulkner, Executive Director, National Novel Writing Month. "As a tiny nonprofit that puts on the world's largest writing event, BookBaby's support is crucial to helping NaNoWriMo spread the transformational magic of creativity."
Last year over 325,000 writers participated in NaNoWriMo, with over 58,000 writers making their goal. Its programs now also include Camp NaNoWriMo during the spring and summer months, and the Young Writer's Program, along with its headline event each November. Over 250 NaNoWriMo novels have been traditionally published including Sara Gruen's <em>Water for Elephants</em>, Erin Morgenstern's <em>The Night Circus</em>, Hugh Howey's <em>Wool</em>, and Rainbow Rowell's <em>Fangirl</em>.</p>

     	<h2>BookBaby Introduces Print On Demand Books with the Industry’s Widest Distribution Network </h2>
		<h3>Self-published authors can now gain unprecedented worldwide book distribution for both eBooks and printed books in 100+ stores and catalogs.</h3>

		<p><em>Portland, OR</em> – <a href="/">BookBaby</a>, the self-publishing powerhouse, announces a game-changing <a href="/print-on-demand">on demand book printing</a> and distribution service that gives authors and publishers the chance to <a href="/ebook-distribution">sell their printed books</a> in dozens of stores and catalogs, including Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and Powell’s, as well as the complete Ingram and Baker & Taylor networks. Combined with BookBaby’s popular <a href="/print-on-demand">eBook distribution services</a>, self-published authors can now place their books in over 100+ online stores and catalogs around the globe.</p>

<p>Print On Demand (POD) allows authors to sell printed books worldwide without paying for large print runs, inventory and warehousing issues, or handling their own order fulfillment. Books are printed and shipped to customers as needed — and because BookBaby’s POD service comes paired with global distribution, sales can come from almost anywhere in the world. </p>

<p>“This is different from any other Print On Demand program out on the marketplace,” said Steven Spatz, BookBaby President. “Not only do we offer the most robust book distribution network in the business, we also deliver the highest-quality <a href="/book-printing">custom printed books</a> and back that up with a 100% satisfaction guarantee.”</p>

<p>“Self-published authors need all the exposure they can get for their books. They deserve to have a place on book store shelves around the world, and our program delivers the maximum exposure through retail stores and wholesale catalogs.”</p>

<p>Unlike other Print On Demand providers, BookBaby uses the very same digital printing presses for their POD books as they do for their larger print runs. “Let’s be honest,” says Spatz. “The print quality for books printed on demand can be spotty. It’s a problem for authors and publishers who get books printed for local sales and also get on-demand printing for global reach because all-too-frequently the book quality differs between the commercially printed books and the POD version. This has been an ongoing problem in the industry for years. BookBaby has changed that. Every single book we print is of the highest-quality in the industry. An author’s first book will be identical to their 1,000th.”</p>

<p>BookBaby’s Print On Demand service allows authors to concentrate on the essentials of self-publishing success — writing and promotion — and leaves all the manufacturing, book distribution, and shipping work entirely up to BookBaby. Whenever a POD client’s book is purchased in a store, online, or ordered by a wholesaler such as Ingram or Baker & Taylor, BookBaby will print, bind, and ship it within five days. </p>

<p>“Beautifully printed books, true global reach, low upfront cost, one-time sign up, and sell forever– that’s our on-demand printing service in a nutshell,” says Spatz. “When you add that to our strong eBook program, it means we’re serving 100% of an author’s go-to market needs like no one else in the industry.”</p>

<p>“For the first time ever, self-published authors can truly be everywhere they need to be, in all formats, in all the important places, with hand crafted quality books they can be proud of.”</p>

<p>With offices in Portland, Oregon and the Philadelphia area, BookBaby is the sister company to CD Baby, the world’s largest online distributor of independent music. BookBaby offers complete ePublishing and printing services to independent authors.

     	<h2>BookBaby adds 50+ stores and more to new eBook publishing package</h2>
<h3>New, simplified ePublishing offer includes greatly expanded eBook distribution network, additional marketing tools, and even more customer support</h3>

<p><em>Portland, OR</em> – FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE – eBook distribution powerhouse <a href="/" class="highlight">BookBaby</a> launched a newly enhanced eBook publishing program today, designed to simplify the digital publishing process for authors around the globe. With <a href="/ebook-distribution">"50+ new eBook stores in its retail network</a>, new book marketing tools, additional customer service support and guaranteed high quality file conversions, all BookBaby authors can now experience a worry-free eBook launch. </p>

<p>To introduce the new and improved program, BookBaby is offering a $100 discount on their <a href="/ebook-services">eBook conversion and distribution package</a> price for a limited time. The discounted fee will be $199 through February 15, 2015.</p>

<p>"Our improved eBook publishing package includes free phone and email support, which provides true peace of mind publishing for self-published authors," said Steven Spatz, BookBaby President.  "Making an eBook can be a stressful and confusing process. There are many eBook publishing companies to choose from, with pricing ranging from free to over $1,000, each of which require the author to do much - if not all - of the work." </p>

<p>"We think self-published authors need an expert to call when they have questions – someone to hold their hand through the process. So we decided to make things simple and put our customer service teams in the forefront of every single eBook project. It's what sets us apart from every other eBook distributor in the industry."</p>

<p>BookBaby has expanded beyond its current Portland, OR-based customer service center with an additional support team in the Philadelphia area, now available to handle questions. "There's nothing like talking to a real live person for help and advice, and our authors know that answers are just a call or email away."</p>


<p>The improvements to BookBaby's eBook publishing and distribution package include:
<ul type="disc">
  <li><strong>A massive expansion of eBook retailers.</strong> BookBaby now offers the largest eBook retail network by far - over 60+ stores worldwide including Amazon, iBooks, Barnes & Noble, Kobo and dozens more. "We've always distributed to the majors," explained Spatz, "but now we're putting our authors' books into many new European, Asian, South American and niche retailers that are the leaders in the local marketplace." </li>
  <li><strong>Additional book marketing tools and services.</strong> BookBaby's exclusive <a href="/bookpromo">BookPromo™</a> book promotion tools now include a new step-by-step guide for pinpointing search terms for authors' listings on Amazon. And for the first time ever, BookBaby is allowing authors to make free changes to their books' metadata information — including price adjustments. "Authors told us they really needed to have this free access and we've delivered," said Spatz.</li>
  <li><strong>Expanded customer service support hours.</strong> With BookBaby publishing experts now in Philadelphia and Portland, authors can call between 9 AM to 8 PM EST on all business days to quickly resolve any book publishing issues. </li>
  <li><strong>Guaranteed high quality eBook file conversions.</strong> With its new singular program, BookBaby handles all of the technical heavy lifting, taking authors' digital source files in Word, PDF and other popular formats and converting them into ePub and .mobi files to be used in all electronic readers around the globe. "Many authors have neither the time nor expertise to create a really good ePub file," said Spatz. "It's a painstaking, detailed process that's often best left to professionals to ensure the eBook is able to be opened and read on all devices."</li>
</ul> </p>
<p>"Of course," continued Spatz, "this eBook publishing package still includes the thing that made it a game-changer in the industry—a payout of 100% of net online sales. BookBaby still takes a zero percent commission of author sales."</p>

<p><strong>About BookBaby:</strong> Distributing eBooks in over 170 countries through more than a dozen online retail stores, including Amazon, iBooks, Barnes &amp; Noble, Kobo, and more, BookBaby offers a full array of services including eBook conversion, eBook formatting, cover design and distribution, as well as <a href="/book-printing" target="_blank" class="highlight">short run book printing</a>. The company also gives each of their authors access to <a href="/bookpromo" class="highlight">BookPromo™</a>, a suite of promotional book services, and <a href="/bookshop" class="highlight">BookShop™</a>, a webpage with an ecommerce option for authors to sell direct to readers. Headquartered in Portland, Oregon, BookBaby was launched in early 2011 and applies the same services and powerful resources as sister company CD Baby to the digital publishing world, to help independent authors and publishers accomplish their goals.

     	<h2>BookBaby Announces New President</h2>
<h3>The ePublishing giant taps Steven Spatz to lead new developments, offers </h3>

<p><em>Pennsauken, NJ</em> – <a href="/" class="highlight">BookBaby</a>, the leading distributor of eBooks through Amazon, iBooks and other retailers, has chosen Steven Spatz as their new president. Spatz has been the Chief Marketing Officer for <a href="http://www.avldigital.com" target="_blank" class="highlight">Audio Video Labs</a> (BookBaby’s parent company) for much of the past 10 years. He’s contributed to many of BookBaby’s recent breakthrough new product developments including <a href="/bookpromo" class="highlight">BookPromo™</a>—a free suite of promotional services to help authors promote and market their books—and <a href="/bookshop" class="highlight">BookShop™</a>, an ecommerce web page where authors can promote and sell their eBooks direct to readers. </p>

<p>“Steven has been an invaluable marketer for AVL on the music side of the business,” said AVL CEO Tony van Veen. “But he took a special interest in BookBaby from day one of this brand and we’re excited to see what he can do with the business.”</p>

<p>“I’ve watched this company grow from its origins as CD Baby’s little brother, to become a leader in its field,” said Spatz. “I can’t wait to devote 100% of my time to this amazing brand.”</p>

<p>Prior to serving as AVL’s chief marketer, Spatz worked with several leading direct marketing businesses including Matchbox Collectibles, Mattel Specialty Retail and Hasbro’s GI Joe Collectibles. He got started in direct to consumer retailing through his family’s business, Pinnacle Orchards, a gourmet fruit and food catalog, after moving on from a short lived stint in newspaper reporting.</p> 

<p>“My background is in journalism, so writing is in my DNA. That’s what makes BookBaby such a perfect fit for me.”</p>

<p>Spatz takes the helm at BookBaby with the understanding that the self-publishing landscape has quickly evolved past distribution as the end goal. “Authors used to be thrilled to have their books listed on Amazon and all the rest,” he said. “Today those same authors aren’t content to just have their books up for sale online. They want to get noticed by readers and become the next rising star, like Hugh Howey.”</p>

<p>The key to self-published authors finding their audience, according to Spatz, may lie in the two promotion and sales tools that every BookBaby author enjoys.
“BookPromo™ has been a slam dunk winner for our authors. After all, every author wants discoverability and BookPromo™ absolutely helps with that,” said Spatz. “By selling their books through their own BookShop™, our authors get paid more than any other retail offers, plus they get paid much faster. What author wouldn’t like that?”</p>

<p>Spatz has been the author of many of the <a href="/free-publishing-guides" class="highlight">self-publishing guides for authors</a> offered on the BookBaby website.  His upcoming book, <em>The End – What’s Next: Six steps to take your manuscript to the marketplace in six weeks</em> is based upon one of the brand’s most popular guides. The book is scheduled to be released in late fall. </p>

     	<h2>BookBaby lets authors sell eBooks direct and earn more</h2>
        <h3>Authors can publish, promote and sell their eBooks like never before with the addition of BookShop.</h3>

<p><em>PORTLAND, OR</em> – <a href="/" class="highlight">BookBaby</a>, the publishing arm of indie music powerhouse CD Baby, is writing a whole new chapter in self publishing with the opening of <a href="/bookshop" class="highlight">BookShop</a>. All BookBaby authors can now sell their eBooks directly to readers through their own free BookShop e-commerce webpage, earning more money per sale and getting paid faster than ever before.</p> 

<p>BookBaby authors will now be able to sell ePub and .mobi versions of their eBooks directly to their readers (earning 85% of the gross selling price) and also link fans to their eBook on popular retail sites such as iBooks, Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and others. What’s more, instead of holding onto authors’ money for weeks or even months like other distributors and retailers, BookBaby pays its authors within one week of the sale.</p>

<p>“It’s very simple. BookShop pays more and pays fast. Faster than anyone else,” said Steven Spatz, Chief Marketing Officer for BookBaby. “That’s what every author is looking for. For example if you sell an eBook for ten bucks on a Friday, you’ll see $8.50 show up in your account the following Monday. No other company gets money back to its authors like BookBaby.” </p>

<p>BookShop is free to every BookBaby author, including writers who are now taking advantage of the company’s new FREE eBook publishing package. Authors can upload ePub files directly to BookBaby for worldwide eBook distribution without any upfront costs.</p>

<p>BookShop is the latest addition to BookBaby’s fast-growing list of products and services to help authors find success in the marketplace. “It used to be that writers were thrilled just to have their manuscripts turned into an eBook and listed for sale on Amazon," said Spatz. “But for today's independent author, literary success requires a lot more than just great file conversion and retail distribution."</p>

<p>“BookBaby’s new motto is ‘publish, promote and sell.’ While we’ll always help our authors publish books, they also need the opportunity to promote and sell their books. We’ve given our BookBaby authors exactly that with BookPromo™ and now BookShop.”</p>

<p><a href="/bookshop/" class="highlight"><strong>BookPromo™</strong></a>, a free promotional service for all BookBaby authors, debuted in late 2013 and continues to grow with new products and placements with many of the industry’s top promotional companies including GoodReads, PR Newswire, Reader’s Favorite and many more. BookPromo™ features book discovery placements, free reviews, promotional opportunities and resources. </p>

<p>BookBaby is the sister company to CD Baby, the world’s largest online distributor of independent music. Founded as a garage start-up in 1998, CD Baby has grown to become one of the most trusted names in the independent music business, paying over a quarter billion dollars to over 300,000 artists worldwide.  The company’s newest brand is following in the footsteps of its corporate sibling by helping independent authors realize their literary dreams.  “With CD Baby we’ve brought musicians and fans directly together,” said Spatz. “BookBaby and BookShop are going to do exactly the same for authors and readers. First BookPromo™ and now BookShop - it’s clear that BookBaby is turning the page. It’s a whole new chapter in self publishing.”</p>

        <h3>Scribd, the world’s largest online library, will now include books by thousands of independent authors represented by BookBaby, making it easy for readers to access those titles from any web-enabled device.</h3>
		<p><em>PORTLAND, OR</em> – BookBaby, already the largest <a href="/ebook-distribution" class="highlight">eBook distribution network</a> for independent authors, has announced the further expansion of its network through a new partnership with Scribd, the world’s largest online library of stories, novels, essays, and more. Scribd, which has been called “the social network for reading,” allows users to access a vast cloud-based library from any computer or mobile device. </p>
<p>“Scribd is one of the best book-discovery tools out there, and I’m thrilled that BookBaby authors will now be able to leverage those features to sell more eBooks,” says BookBaby president Brian Felsen. “Independent authors will now be included in Scribd’s catalog, alongside the catalogs of over 150 publishers.”</p>
<p>Scribd’s iPaper technology (a rich document format similar to PDF) displays each title in its own web-based iPaper viewer, allowing users to embed the document on other websites and blogs while preserving its original format. Readers can sample up to 10% of an eBook for free, after which point they must pay to access the complete document — readable “in the cloud” from any computer or mobile device. </p>
<p>“Scribd has converted over a billion pages of written works into web-pages,” says Felsen. “Over a million people visit Scribd every day to discuss business presentations, poetry, the latest bestsellers, and magazine articles. It’s a huge community of avid and engaged readers — and now they’ll be able to read and discuss the work of BookBaby’s independent authors too.”</p>
