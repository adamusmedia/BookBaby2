        		<h3>BookBaby handles all the technical details</h3>
            	<p>Lulu and other companies claim that self-publishing is as easy as uploading a word file. But Lulu’s complicated website shows otherwise, practically requiring authors to be graphic designers and printing experts in order to produce a quality book.  We hear reports from authors who routinely complain that some companies allow out-of-spec files to go to print, resulting in poorly printed books. </p>
				<p>That never happens with  BookBaby. Our prepress specialists look closely at every file to make sure they are ready for printing. If they aren’t – we’ll either make minor fixes ourselves or let the author know what needs to be done.  That’s how we deliver the absolute highest-quality printed books to the marketplace – guaranteed!</p>

        		<h3>BookBaby authors get the world’s biggest distribution network for both eBooks and Printed Books.</h3>
            	<p>Lulu distributes eBooks through Amazon, iBooks, Barnes &amp; Noble, Scribd and KOBO.</p>

				<p>Meanwhile BookBaby authors sell through all those stores – <strong>and dozens more</strong>.  From Gardner’s, the UK’s biggest digital book store, to the Baker &amp; Taylor catalog – BookBaby delivers eBooks to over 60 stores in 170 countries.</p>

				<p>For printed books, Lulu distributes through Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, and Ingram.</p>

                	<p>Here’s a cold, hard publishing fact: Bookstore owners won’t take the risk of stocking self-published books if they go unsold. BookBaby offers a returns program to booksellers, making it possible for our authors’ books to find their way into hundreds of retail stores worldwide. </p>
    				<p>Lulu doesn’t offer this program. Neither does CreateSpace, or Ingram-Spark for that matter.</p>

            <h3>Don’t be misled by Lulu’s promises of “free” publishing and book marketing services. </h3>
            <p>On its website, Lulu claims to offer “free” eBook and Printed Book distribution. But when they take a percentage of every author’s sales – up to 20% of net sales – it’s far from being truly “free.” </p>

            <p>You should know that LuLu offers an extensive list of book marketing services on its website. Yet Lulu doesn’t actually do any of the marketing work. Since 2013, they’ve <a href="http://the-digital-reader.com/2013/03/08/lulu-signs-deal-with-the-devil-now-partnered-with-author-solutions/" target="_blank">partnered with Author Solutions</a>, one of the most infamous and controversial “vanity publishing” companies, to provide these services. </p>
