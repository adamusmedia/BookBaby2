            	<h3 class="title-bold">Which publisher is right for you?</h3>
                	<p>We work closely with our valued partner Amazon to distribute your books to their massive audience. But Amazon offers their own Print on Demand service and we frequently get asked which company — BookBaby or CreateSpace — is the best for independent authors. </p>
                    <h2>Here’s how BookBaby stacks up against CreateSpace:</h2>

                    		<p>CreateSpace is an excellent company. However, they primarily serve Amazon. At BookBaby we deliver your books (both eBooks and printed books through our Print on Demand program) to Amazon... AND you can get your books into hundreds of online and brick and mortar retail stores worldwide that are not available when you publish through CreateSpace. </p>

        		<p>Authors who go elsewhere routinely complain that some companies allow out-of-spec files to go to print, resulting in badly-printed books. That doesn’t happen at BookBaby. Our prepress specialists look at every single page, of every single book, we print to make sure it’s perfect. That’s part of how we deliver the absolute highest-quality printed books to the marketplace.  </p>
