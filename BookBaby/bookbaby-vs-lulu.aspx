        <h3 class="title-bold">How do you choose which self-publishing company is right for you?</h3>

        <p class="plr-15">It’s a tough question when you’re self-publishing for the first time. Lulu specializes in volume book printing, which can often yield cheap, low-quality books. And there isn’t much concern for royalties or global distribution. Meanwhile, BookBaby offers everything an author needs to successfully self-publish, including high-quality <a href="/book-printing">book printing</a>, industry-leading <a href="/book-distribution">distribution</a>, <a href="/ebooks">eBook conversion</a>, <a href="/book-cover-design">cover design</a>, <a href="/book-formatting">book formatting</a>, and more. We frequently get asked which company — BookBaby or Lulu — is best for independent authors. If you’re an aspiring author who takes self-publishing seriously, then take a look at how BookBaby differs from Lulu and decide for yourself.</p>

While Lulu takes a selling fee from authors’ profits – up to 20% in some cases—BookBaby doesn’t take a penny, meaning more profit for our authors.</p>

Not with BookBaby. Customer service is one of our strengths. Our US-based self-publishing specialists are standing by to answer any and all of your questions. We want you to feel confident and well informed when you publish your book.</p>

    	            <p>Lulu and other companies claim that self-publishing is as easy as uploading a word file. But Lulu’s complicated website shows otherwise, practically requiring authors to be graphic designers and printing experts in order to produce a quality book.  We hear reports from authors who routinely complain that some companies allow out-of-spec files to go to print, resulting in poorly printed books. </p>
		            <p>That never happens with  BookBaby. Our prepress specialists look closely at every file to make sure they are ready for printing. If they aren’t – we’ll either make minor fixes ourselves or let the author know what needs to be done.  That’s how we deliver the absolute highest-quality printed books to the marketplace – guaranteed!</p>

				    <p>For printed books, Lulu distributes through Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, and Ingram.</p>
