                <h2 class="title-bold">How BookBaby Cover Design Works</h2>
                <p>Using our online order interface, it’s easy to create a project quote for your book. Simply select your book’s trim size, cover style, book binding style, cover finish, print type, paper stock, as well as your design preferences in the add-ons section.</p>
                <p>After you select the design options that are right for you and save your quote, you will be asked to complete a short design questionnaire. This will give you the opportunity to share your vision for your book cover. You can request that our designers find images for you, or you can upload images of your own for us to work with.</p>
                <p>BookBaby designers will combine your input with their own design expertise to create a custom designed book cover that you’ll be proud to show off.</p>
