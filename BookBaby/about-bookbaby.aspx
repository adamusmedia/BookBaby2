        <h2>BookBaby makes self-publishing easy: from cover design, book printing, eBook conversions, distribution, website creation, and more.</h2>

		<p>Based in the Philadelphia-area, we’re a team of authors, poets, bloggers, and artists — so we know the thrills and challenges of bringing a book into this world. That’s why you can reach us by phone (imagine that!) and talk through the process with a real human being – a fellow writer who’s invested in the success of your book.</p>

		<p>Since 2011, we’ve helped thousands realize their publishing goals, and we’ve paid out millions of dollars in royalties to authors like you.</p>

		<p>BookBaby offers you the largest eBook distribution network, including Amazon, Apple, Kobo, Barnes & Noble, and many other popular retailers in over 170 countries around the globe. </p>

		<p>It’s now possible for you to reach a worldwide audience, keep 100% of your book’s net earnings, retain the rights to your work, and maintain total creative control. BookBaby provides everything you need to professionally publish and distribute your book, without ever having to sell-out to ‘big publishing.’</p>

		<p class="mb-30">BookBaby is the sister company to <a href="http://cdbaby.com" target="_blank" title="CD Baby">CD Baby</a>, the world’s largest online distributor of independent music. Founded as a garage startup in 1998, CD Baby has grown to become one of the most trusted names in the independent music business, paying over a quarter billion dollars to over 300,000 artists worldwide. </p>
