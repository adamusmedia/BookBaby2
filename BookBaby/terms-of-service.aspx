                    <p>(i) We will maintain Books and records which report the sale or other licensed uses of your Books.

Such Certified Public Accountant will act only under an acceptable confidentiality agreement, which provides that any information derived from such audit or examination will not be knowingly released, divulged or published to any person, firm or corporation, other than to you or to a judicial or administrative body in connection with any proceeding relating to this Agreement. Your CPA may make those examinations only for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of the statements sent to you. All such examinations will be in accordance with GAAP procedures and regulations. Your CPA may make such an examination for a particular statement only once, and only within one (1) year after the date we send you that statement. Your CPA may make such an examination only during our usual business hours, and at the place where we keep the Books and records to be examined. If you wish to make an examination, you will be required to notify us at least thirty (30) days before the date when you plan to begin it. We may postpone the commencement of your examination by notice given to you not later than five (5) days before the commencement date specified in your notice; if we do so, the running of the time within which the examination may be made will be suspended during the postponement. If your examination has not been completed within one (1) month from the time you begin it, we may require you to terminate it on seven (7) days' notice to you at any time; we will not be required to permit you to continue the examination after the end of that seven (7) day period. Your CPA will not be entitled to examine any other records that do not specifically report sales or other licensed uses of the Digital Books. (i) If you have any objections to a statement, you will give us specific notice of that objection and your reasons for it within one (1) year after the date when we are required to send you that statement. Each statement will become conclusively binding on you at the end of that one (1) year period, and you will no longer have any right to make any other objections to it. You will not have the right to sue us in connection with any statement, or to sue us for your share of Digital License Fees on sales and licenses during the period a statement covers, unless you commence the suit within that one (1) year period. If you commence suit on any controversy or claim concerning statements rendered to you under this Agreement in a court of competent jurisdiction, the scope of the proceeding will be limited to determination of the amount of the Digital License Fees due to you for the accounting periods concerned, and the court will have no authority to consider any other issues or award any relief except recovery of any Digital License Fees found owing. Your recovery of any such royalties will be the sole remedy available to you by reason of any claim related to our statements.</p>
                    <p>(j) <strong>Tax Information</strong>. BookBaby will use its reasonable efforts to collect sales and other taxes owed on the sale of the Author Content ("Sales Tax"), and to remit such Sales Tax or other similar taxes including VAT (Value Added Tax) in relevant taxing jurisdictions, on your behalf to relevant government authorities.

                    <p><strong>17. Indemnification:</strong></p>
                    <p>(a) <strong>Indemnification.</strong> You hereby indemnify, and hold us harmless from any and all damages, claims, liabilities, costs, losses and expenses (including, but not limited to, legal costs and attorneys' fees) (collectively, "Claims") arising out of or connected with any claim, demand, or action which arises out of any breach or alleged breach or violation of any of the warranties, representations, covenants or agreements made by you in this Agreement, including, but not limited to, your representations and warranties regarding noninfringement of any copyrights or any other rights in and to any other forms of intellectual property. You will reimburse us, on demand, for any payment made by us at any time with respect to any damage, liability, cost, loss or expense to which the foregoing indemnity applies. Pending the determination of any claim, demand, or action, we may, at our election, withhold payment of any monies otherwise payable to you hereunder in an amount which does not exceed your potential liability to us pursuant to this paragraph.</p>
                    <p>(b) <strong>Indemnification Request</strong>.

If we, in our reasonable and good faith judgment conclude that you are not capable of defending your or our interests against any Claims, then we shall have the option to control the defense in any matter or litigation through counsel of our own choosing to defend against any such Claim for which you owe BookBaby an indemnification, and the costs of such counsel, as well as any court costs, shall be at your expense.</p>
                    <p><strong>18. Copyright and Intellectual Property Infringements</strong></p>
                    <p>Notice and procedure for making claims of copyright or other intellectual property infringements.</p>
                    <p>(a) BookBaby respects the intellectual property of others and takes the protection of copyrights and all other intellectual property very seriously, and we ask our users to do the same. Infringing activity will not be tolerated on or through the Site or the BookBaby Service.</p>
                    <p>(b) BookBaby’s intellectual property policy is to (1) remove material that BookBaby believes in good faith, upon notice from an intellectual property owner or their agent, is infringing the intellectual property of a third party by being made available through the Site, and (2) remove any Products or Submissions posted to the Site by “repeat infringers.” BookBaby considers a “repeat infringer” to be any user that has uploaded Products or Submissions to the Service and for whom BookBaby has received more than two takedown notices compliant with the provisions of 17 U.S.C. § 512(c) with respect to such Products or Submissions. BookBaby has discretion, however, to terminate the account of any user after receipt of a single notification of claimed infringement or upon BookBaby’s own determination.</p>
                    <p>(c) Procedure for Reporting Claimed Infringement. If you believe that any Productions or Submissions made available on or through the Site or the BookBaby Service have been used or exploited in a manner that infringes an intellectual property right you own or control, then please promptly send a “Notification of Claimed Infringement” containing the following information to the Designated Agent identified below. Your communication must include substantially the following:</p>
                    <p>(i) A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the work(s) that has/have been allegedly infringed;</p>
                    <p>(ii) Identification of works or materials being infringed, or, if multiple works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works;</p>
                    <p>(iii) Identification of the specific material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit BookBaby to locate the material;</p>
                    <p>(iv)Information reasonably sufficient to permit BookBaby to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which you may be contacted;</p>
                    <p>(v) A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</p>
                    <p>(vi) A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. You should consult with your own lawyer and/or see 17 U.S.C. § 512 to confirm your obligations to provide a valid notice of claimed infringement.</p>
                    <p>(d) Designated Agent Contact Information. BookBaby shares CD Baby’s Designated Agent for notices of claimed infringement and can be contacted at:</p>
                    <p>Via E-mail : <a href="mailto:Copyright@cdbaby.com">Copyright@cdbaby.com</a></p>
                    <p>Via U.S. Mail : Attn: Joel Andrew, 13909 NE Airport Way, Portland, OR 97230</p>
                    <p>(e) Counter Notification. If you receive a notification from BookBaby that material made available by you on or through the Site or the BookBaby Service has been the subject of a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then you will have the right to provide BookBaby with what is called a “Counter Notification.” To be effective, a Counter Notification must be in writing, provided to BookBaby’s Designated Agent through one of the methods identified in Section 11(d) of this TOS, and include substantially the following information:</p>
                    <p>(i) A physical or electronic signature of the subscriber;</p>
                    <p>(ii) Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;</p>
                    <p>(iii) A statement under penalty of perjury that the subscriber has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and</p>
                    <p>(iv) The subscriber’s name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that the subscriber consents to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if the subscriber’s address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which BookBaby may be found, and that the subscriber will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under Section 11(c) of this TOS above or an agent of such person. A party submitting a Counter Notification should consult a lawyer or see 17 U.S.C. § 512 to confirm the party’s obligations to provide a valid counter notification under the Copyright Act.</p>
                    <p>(f) False Notifications of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notifications. The Copyright Act provides that: [a]ny person who knowingly materially misrepresents under [Section 512 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512)] (1) that material or activity is infringing, or (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, shall be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner’s authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of [BookBaby] relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.</p>
                    <p><strong>19. Disclaimers:</strong></p>
                    <p>(a) THE WEBSITE, THE SERVICES, AND ANY THIRD-PARTY CONTENT, SOFTWARE, SERVICES OR APPLICATIONS MADE AVAILABLE IN CONJUNCTION WITH OR THROUGH THE WEBSITE, ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS," "AS AVAILABLE," "WITH ALL FAULTS" BASIS WITHOUT REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IN TERMS OF CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE.</p>
                    <p>(b) TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE LAW, BOOKBABY AND ITS AFFILIATES, PARTNERS, LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL EXPRESS, IMPLIED AND STATUTORY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND RELATING TO THE SERVICES, THE WEBSITE OR THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM BOOKBABY OR THROUGH THE WEBSITE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN. BOOKBABY AND ITS AFFILIATES, PARTNERS, LICENSORS, AND SUPPLIERS DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE WEBSITE OR ANY PART THEREOF, OR ANY SERVICES PROVIDED BY BOOKBABY, WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, OR FREE OF ERRORS, VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS AND DO NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THE FOREGOING WILL BE CORRECTED. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU USE, ACCESS, DOWNLOAD, OR OTHERWISE OBTAIN INFORMATION, MATERIALS, OR DATA THROUGH THE WEBSITE OR ANY ASSOCIATED SITES OR APPLICATIONS, AND OFFER THE AUTHOR CONTENT VIA THE SERVICES, AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY (INCLUDING YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM, HANDSET, OR ANY OTHER DEVICE OR PERIPHERAL USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE WEBSITE) OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD OR USE OF SUCH MATERIAL OR DATA.</p>
                    <p><strong>20. Limitation of Liability; Basis of the Bargain:</strong></p>
                    <p>(a) BOOKBABY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY NATURE, FOR ANY REASON, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY IS ASSERTED ON THE BASIS OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY) OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. BOOKBABY SHALL ALSO NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY ROYALTIES, FEES, PAYMENTS OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE FAILURE OF ANY LICENSEE TO PAY BOOKBABY OR YOU ANY ROYALTIES THAT ARE DUE FOR ANY USE OR MISUSE OF THE AUTHOR CONTENT, WHETHER PURSUANT TO AN EXISTING, EXPIRED OR TERMINATED AGREEMENT WITH BOOKBABY OR OTHERWISE. BOOKBABY'S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL IN ALL INSTANCES BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT OF MONIES ACTUALLY PAID TO YOU BY BOOKBABY FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OR LICENSING OF THE AUTHOR CONTENT DURING THE SIX (6)-MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE OF YOUR CLAIM AGAINST BOOKBABY.</p>
                    <p>(b) APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY OR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN SUCH CASES, YOU AGREE THAT BECAUSE SUCH DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY REFLECT A REASONABLE AND FAIR ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN YOU AND BOOKBABY, AND ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN YOU AND BOOKBABY, BOOKBABY'S LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BOOKBABY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO OFFER ITS SERVICES TO YOU ON AN ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE BASIS WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS AND WOULD NOT OFFER SUCH SERVICES ABSENT A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</p>
