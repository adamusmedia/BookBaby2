                        <p>No other genre of book is as associated with self-publishing as the poetry book, or chapbook. Whitman, Eliot, Poe, Pope, Shelley, Cummings, Browning, and so many other poetry greats all paid to publish their first books. Too bad they didn’t have BookBaby. For not only did they have to write good poems, they had to struggle to typeset, print, and bind the books that housed them. BookBaby makes this a breeze. You can order beautiful poetry books from the comfort of your home. And our amazing <a href="/print-on-demand">Print On Demand service</a> service allows you to quickly and easily sell your books all over the world. So whether you’re looking to send books to poetry publishers or looking to self-publish your own chapbooks, you’ll never wander lonely as a cloud with BookBaby by your side.</p>
